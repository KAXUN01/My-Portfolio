# About My Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **portfolio project**! This project showcases my work as a **Full Stack Developer** and **DevOps Engineer**. It's designed to give you a glimpse into the skills and tools I use, as well as the projects I have worked on. Here's an overview of the key features and technologies behind this portfolio:

### Key Features

- **Smooth Animations**: I've implemented smooth transitions and animations for elements like headings, text, and images using **Framer Motion**.
- **Interactive UI**: The portfolio includes interactive sections like skill sets, a project showcase, and more to engage visitors.
- **Medium Blog Integration**: My blog posts on **Medium** are displayed on the portfolio, keeping the content fresh and updated.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js**, **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Three.js** for 3D animations.
- **Backend**: My **Node.js** backend handles server-side rendering and API requests.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **AWS EC2** with a **CI/CD pipeline** implemented using **GitHub Actions** for seamless updates and automated deployment.
